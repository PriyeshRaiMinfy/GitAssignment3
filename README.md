# Assignment 3: Git Branching & Merge Conflicts

## Summary
This assignment demonstrates how to create and merge two feature branches that modify the same file, resulting in a merge conflict.

## Branches
- `feature/header-update`: Updated header text
- `feature/header-edit`: Added inline styling to header

## Merge Conflict
A conflict occurred in `index.html` due to both branches modifying the same `<header>` block. It was resolved by combining both text and styles.
